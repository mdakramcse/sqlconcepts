--In SQL, to select each and every column in a table, you can use * instead of manually typing out all the column names:

SELECT *
 FROM table_name;

--The SQL WHERE clause can be combined with the SELECT statement  to output only certain rows, based on if they meet certain conditions:

SELECT column1, column2, ...
FROM table_name
WHERE condition;

--The WHERE clause is often used with other logical operators like = (equals) and != (not equals) to filter down rows.=,!=,<,>,<=,>=
